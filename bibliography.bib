	abstract = {The growth and survival of cells within tissues can be affected by ‘cell competition’ between different cell clones. This phenomenon was initially recognized between wild-type cells and cells with mutations in ribosomal protein (Rp) genes in Drosophila melanogaster. However, competition also affects D. melanogaster cells with mutations in epithelial polarity genes, and wild-type cells exposed to ‘super-competitor’ cells with mutation in the Salvador–Warts–Hippo tumour suppressor pathway or expressing elevated levels of Myc. More recently, cell competition and super-competition were recognized in mammalian development, organ homeostasis and cancer. Genetic and cell biological studies have revealed that mechanisms underlying cell competition include the molecular recognition of ‘different’ cells, signalling imbalances between distinct cell populations and the mechanical consequences of differential growth rates; these mechanisms may also involve innate immune proteins, p53 and changes in translation.},

	abstract = {Cell competition in the thymus promotes turnover and functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting leukemia. Using thymus transplantation experiments, we have shown that the presence of T lymphocyte precursors, recently seeding the thymus, promotes the clearance of precursors with a longer time of thymus residency. If cell competition is impaired and no cells seed the thymus, the organ is capable of sustaining T lymphocyte production, a state termed thymus autonomy. However, we observed consistently that prolonged autonomy is permissive to the emergence of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T‐
              ALL
              ). This resembled the onset of T‐
              ALL
              in patients treated by gene therapy for X‐linked severe combined immunodeficiency (
              SCID
              ‐X1). Following treatment, thymus activity was established, with T lymphocyte production, although no bone marrow contribution was detected. However, some patients developed T‐
              ALL
              . The favored explanation for malignant transformation was considered to be genotoxicity due to integration of the retroviral vector next to oncogenes, thereby activating them ectopically. Although plausible, we consider an alternative, mutually nonexclusive explanation: that any condition enabling prolonged thymus autonomy will promote leukemogenesis. In support of this view, two independent studies have recently shown that the efficacy of reconstitution of the bone marrow in the context of
              SCID
              ‐X1 dramatically influences the outcome of treatment, and that lymphoid malignancies emerge following transplantation of a small number of healthy progenitors. Here, we discuss the most recent data in light of our own studies in thymopoiesis and the conditions that trigger malignant transformation of thymocytes in various experimental and clinical settings.},

However, it remains unknown what happens at the boundary between normal and transformed cells. Using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells transformed with temperature-sensitive v-Src, we have examined the interface between normal and Src-transformed epithelial cells. We show that Src-transformed cells are apically extruded when surrounded by normal cells, but not when Src cells alone are cultured, suggesting that apical extrusion occurs in a cell-context-dependent manner. We also observe apical extrusion of Src-transformed cells in the enveloping layer of zebrafish gastrula embryos. When Src-transformed MDCK cells are surrounded by normal MDCK cells, myosin-II and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are activated in Src cells, which further activate downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Importantly, activation of these signalling pathways depends on the presence of surrounding normal cells and plays a crucial role in apical extrusion of Src cells. Collectively, these results indicate that interaction with surrounding normal epithelial cells influences the signalling pathways and behaviour of Src-transformed cells.},

            Cell competition is a cell-cell interaction by which a cell compares its fitness to that of neighboring cells. The cell with the relatively lower fitness level is the “loser” and actively eliminated, while the cell with the relatively higher fitness level is the “winner” and survives. Recent studies have shown that cells with high Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity win cell competitions but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we report the unexpected finding that cells overexpressing constitutively active YAP undergo apical extrusion and are losers, rather than winners, in competitions with normal mammalian epithelial cells. Inhibitors of metabolism-related proteins such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), or p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) suppressed this apical extrusion, as did knockdown of vimentin or filamin in neighboring cells. Interestingly, YAP-overexpressing cells switched from losers to winners when co-cultured with cells expressing K-Ras (G12V) or v-Src. Thus, the role of YAP in deciding cell competitions depends on metabolic factors and the status of neighboring cells.},

In this study we examine the interface between normal and Scribble-knockdown epithelial cells using Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells expressing Scribble short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in a tetracycline-inducible manner. We observe that Scribble-knockdown cells undergo apoptosis and are apically extruded from the epithelium when surrounded by normal cells. Apoptosis does not occur when Scribble-knockdown cells are cultured alone, suggesting that the presence of surrounding normal cells induces the cell death. We also show that death of Scribble-knockdown cells occurs independently of apical extrusion. Finally, we demonstrate that apoptosis of Scribble-knockdown cells depends on activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This is the first demonstration that an oncogenic transformation within an epithelium induces cell competition in a mammalian cell culture system.},

To evolve, however, they must surmount a persistent challenge: ensuring that their constituent cells cooperate with one another rather than “cheat” or compete with each other for resources.

                et al.
              
              (p.
              1511
              , published online 12 September) performed a genome-wide screen in induced pluripotent stem cells to search for genes that promote cell cooperation. A number of genes were identified of which knockdown allowed competitive behavior to dominate. These genes formed a network centered on p53, topoisomerase 1, and olfactory receptors. Thus, a genetic mechanism may promote cooperation in the developing embryo.

              Ensuring cooperation among formerly autonomous cells has been a central challenge in the evolution of multicellular organisms. One solution is monoclonality, but this option still leaves room for exploitative behavior, as it does not eliminate genetic and epigenetic variability. We therefore hypothesized that embryonic development must be protected by robust regulatory mechanisms that prevent aberrant clones from superseding wild-type cells. Using a genome-wide screen in murine induced pluripotent stem cells, we identified a network of genes (centered on
              p53
              ,
              topoisomerase 1
              , and olfactory receptors) whose down-regulation caused the cells to replace wild-type cells in vitro and in the mouse embryo—without perturbing normal development. These genes thus appear to fulfill an unexpected role in fostering cell cooperation.},

The effectiveness of CB in producing tetraploid embryos is limited by the asynchrony of 2nd cleavage, both between eggs and between sister blastomeres. Two-cell presumed tetraploids were transplanted to recipients and examined between the 6th and 11th day of pregnancy. Up to 6i days development is normal and most embryos form egg-cylinders. At l{\textbackslash} days the embryonic part of the cylinders is underdeveloped and in later development fails to form an embryo. Development of foetal membranes is much less affected and in the most successfully developing egg-cylinders their formation can be fully accomplished. Failure of embryonic development appears to be due to subnormal activity of the primitive streak, resulting in shortage of mesoderm. Postimplantation development of 2n/4n mosaics was normal. While in embryos tetraploid cells were either absent or in very low proportion (below 4 \%), their contribution to the foetal membranes amounted in some cases to up to 50 \%. Elimination of tetraploid cells from mosaic embryos suggests that they have a lower proliferation rate than diploid cells.},

            Mammalian tetraploid embryos die in early development because of defects in the epiblast. Experiments with diploid/tetraploid chimeric mice, obtained via the aggregation of embryonic stem cells, clarified that while tetraploid cells are excluded from epiblast derivatives, diploid embryos with tetraploid extraembryonic tissues can develop to term. Today, this method, known as tetraploid complementation, is usually used for rescuing extraembryonic defects or for obtaining completely embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived pups. However, it is still unknown why defects occur in the epiblast during mammalian development. Here, we demonstrated that downregulation of p53, a tumour suppressor protein, rescued tetraploid development in the mammalian epiblast. Tetraploidy in differentiating epiblast cells triggered p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting the activation of a tetraploidy checkpoint during early development. Finally, we found that p53 downregulation rescued tetraploid embryos later in gestation.},

Consequently, it is becoming increasingly apparent that pluripotent cells can compare their fitness levels and signal the elimination of those cells that are less fit than their neighbours. In mammals the nature of the pathways that communicate fitness remain largely unknown. Here we identify that in the early mouse embryo and upon exit from naive pluripotency, the confrontation of cells with different fitness levels leads to an inhibition of mTOR signalling in the less fit cell type, causing its elimination. We show that during this process, p53 acts upstream of mTOR and is required to repress its activity. Finally, we demonstrate that during normal development around 35\% of cells are eliminated by this pathway, highlighting the importance of this mechanism for embryonic development.},

	abstract = {Significance
            In response to a variety of stress signals, tumor suppressor p53 is activated to influence the cellular outcome. Various stresses result in different levels of p53 activation. We demonstrate here that during mouse development, uniform activation of p53 at a moderate level is well tolerated in the embryos. In contrast, mild activation of p53 in individual cells leads to a growth disadvantage and their out-competition when they are present together with nonactivated cells. These results suggest that p53 may coordinate at a multicellular level for optimal stress response and fitness of the organism.
          , 
            
              The function of tumor suppressor p53 has been under intense investigation. Acute stresses such as DNA damage are able to trigger a high level of p53 activity, leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In contrast, the cellular response of mild p53 activity induced by low-level stress in vivo remains largely unexplored. Murine double minute (MDM)2 and MDM4 are two major negative regulators of p53. Here, we used the strategy of haploinsufficiency of
              Mdm2
              and
              Mdm4
              to induce mild p53 activation in vivo and found that
              Mdm2
              +/−
              Mdm4
              +/−
              double-heterozygous mice exhibited normal embryogenesis. However, closer examination demonstrated that the

              Mdm4
              +/−
              cells exhibited a growth disadvantage and were outcompeted during development in genetic mosaic embryos that contained wild-type cells. Further study indicated the out-competition phenotype was dependent on the levels of p53. These observations revealed that cells with mild p53 activation were less fit and exhibited altered fates in a heterotypic environment, resembling the cell competition phenomenon first uncovered in
              Drosophila
              . By marking unfit cells for elimination, p53 may exert its physiological role to ensure organ and animal fitness.},

            Most human pre-implantation embryos are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells. To determine the fate of aneuploid cells and the developmental potential of mosaic embryos, here we generate a mouse model of chromosome mosaicism. By treating embryos with a spindle assembly checkpoint inhibitor during the four- to eight-cell division, we efficiently generate aneuploid cells, resulting in embryo death during peri-implantation development. Live-embryo imaging and single-cell tracking in chimeric embryos, containing aneuploid and euploid cells, reveal that the fate of aneuploid cells depends on lineage: aneuploid cells in the fetal lineage are eliminated by apoptosis, whereas those in the placental lineage show severe proliferative defects. Overall, the proportion of aneuploid cells is progressively depleted from the blastocyst stage onwards. Finally, we show that mosaic embryos have full developmental potential, provided they contain sufficient euploid cells, a finding of significance for the assessment of embryo vitality in the clinic.},

	abstract = {High levels of aneuploidy have been observed in disease-free tissues, including post-mitotic tissues such as the brain. Using a quantitative interphase-ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization approach, we previously reported a chromosome-speciﬁc, age-related increase in aneuploidy in the mouse cerebral cortex. Increased aneuploidy has been associated with defects in DNA repair and the spindle assembly checkpoint, which in turn can lead to premature aging. Here, we quantiﬁed the frequency of aneuploidy of three autosomes in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of adult and developing brain of Bub1bH/H mice, which have a faulty mitotic checkpoint, and Ercc1−/Δ7 mice, defective in nucleotide excision repair and inter-strand cross-link repair. Surprisingly, the level of aneuploidy in the brain of these murine models of accelerated aging remains as low as in the young adult brains from control animals, i.e. {\textless}1\% in the cerebral cortex and ∼0.1\% in the cerebellum. Therefore, based on aneuploidy, these adult mice with reduced life span and accelerated progeroid features are indistinguishable from age-matched, normal controls.

            Recent genetic analyses of large populations have revealed that somatic mutations in hematopoietic cells leading to clonal expansion are commonly acquired during human aging. Clonally restricted hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of subsequent diagnosis of myeloid or lymphoid neoplasia and increased all-cause mortality. Although myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are defined by cytopenias, dysplastic morphology of blood and marrow cells, and clonal hematopoiesis, most individuals who acquire clonal hematopoiesis during aging will never develop MDS. Therefore, acquisition of somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion in the absence of cytopenias and dysplastic hematopoiesis can be considered clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), analogous to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, which are precursor states for hematologic neoplasms but are usually benign and do not progress. Because mutations are frequently observed in healthy older persons, detection of an MDS-associated somatic mutation in a cytopenic patient without other evidence of MDS may cause diagnostic uncertainty. Here we discuss the nature and prevalence of CHIP, distinction of this state from MDS, and current areas of uncertainty regarding diagnostic criteria for myeloid malignancies.},

Across 234 biopsies of sun-exposed eyelid epidermis from four individuals, the burden of somatic mutations averaged two to six mutations per megabase per cell, similar to that seen in many cancers, and exhibited characteristic signatures of exposure to ultraviolet light. Remarkably, multiple cancer genes are under strong positive selection even in physiologically normal skin, including most of the key drivers of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Positively selected mutations were found in 18 to 32\% of normal skin cells at a density of {\textasciitilde}140 driver mutations per square centimeter.

              INTRODUCTION
              Cancer genome studies have contributed to the analysis and discovery of somatic mutations that drive cancer growth. However, studying the genetic makeup of a tumor when it is already fully developed limits our ability to uncover how and which somatic mutations accumulate in normal tissues in the stages preceding cancer initiation. To address this challenge, recent studies performed deep sequencing in a limited number of tissue types and a small number of individuals, identifying a large number of microscopic clones carrying somatic mutations, some in known cancer genes. These findings emphasize the need to uncover the genomic events that occur in all normal tissues. Although efforts have begun to collect and analyze DNA from normal tissues, we still lack a comprehensive catalog of genetic events and clonal properties across a large number of tissues and individuals. By analyzing the information-rich content in RNA now available from recent advances in RNA sequencing methods, we may be able to substantially expand the scope and scale of these studies.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Some mutations found in the DNA can be detected in the corresponding RNA, depending on the mutation allele fraction and sequence coverage. We therefore hypothesized that a careful analysis of RNA sequences from normal bulk tissues could uncover somatic mutations reflecting macroscopic clones within the samples. In this work, we used the large collection of RNA sequences from the Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, representing more than 6700 samples from {\textasciitilde}500 individuals, spanning across 29 different normal tissues.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We developed a new method, called RNA-MuTect, to identify somatic mutations using a tissue-derived RNA sample and its matched-normal DNA. We validated RNA-MuTect on both tumor-adjacent and cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), wherein DNA and RNA were coextracted from the same samples. Focusing on mutations contained within sufficiently covered sequences, RNA-MuTect achieved high sensitivity and precision, enabling the discovery of most driver events and mutational processes from TCGA tumor RNA data. When applied to the GTEx dataset of normal tissues, multiple somatic mutations were detected in almost all individuals and tissues studied here, including in known cancer genes. The three tissues with the largest number of somatic mutations were sun-exposed skin, esophagus mucosa, and lung; this finding suggests that environmental exposure can promote somatic mosaicism. Both the individuals’ age and tissue-specific proliferation rate were found to be associated with the number of detected mutations. A dN/dS (ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions) analysis suggested that some of the mutations identified in cancer genes may confer a selective advantage. In addition, allelic imbalance events at the chromosome arm level were detected in normal tissues.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Genetic clones carrying somatic mutations are detected across normal tissues to different extents, and these differences depend on factors such as the tissue’s exposure to environmental mutagens, natural architecture, proliferation rate, and the microenvironment. Some of these clones may be the result of genetic drift. Others, however, may develop as a result of positive selection driven by certain somatic events, thus potentially representing the earliest stages of tumorigenesis. Higher-resolution studies of normal tissues and precancerous lesions are required if we are to advance our understanding of both aging and early cancer development.
              
                
                  Somatic clonal expansions in normal human tissues.
                  RNA sequences from 29 normal human tissues collected as part of the Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx) project are analyzed using RNA-MuTect, a method developed for detecting somatic mutations in RNA-seq data. Macroscopic clonal expansions, characterized by shared somatic mutations, are detected in all tissues; skin, esophagus, and lung have the largest number of somatic mutations.

            How somatic mutations accumulate in normal cells is poorly understood. A comprehensive analysis of RNA sequencing data from {\textasciitilde}6700 samples across 29 normal tissues revealed multiple somatic variants, demonstrating that macroscopic clones can be found in many normal tissues. We found that sun-exposed skin, esophagus, and lung have a higher mutation burden than other tested tissues, which suggests that environmental factors can promote somatic mosaicism. Mutation burden was associated with both age and tissue-specific cell proliferation rate, highlighting that mutations accumulate over both time and number of cell divisions. Finally, normal tissues were found to harbor mutations in known cancer genes and hotspots. This study provides a broad view of macroscopic clonal expansion in human tissues, thus serving as a foundation for associating clonal expansion with environmental factors, aging, and risk of disease.},

In the context of development, it is important to understand the mechanisms that coordinate growth and patterning of tissues. Imaginal discs, which are larval precursors of fly limbs and organs, have provided much of what we currently know about these processes. Here, we consider the mechanism that is responsible for the observed uniformity of growth in wing imaginal discs, which persists in the presence of gradients in growth inducing morphogens in spite of the stochastic nature of cell division. The phenomenon of “cell competition,” which manifests in apoptosis of slower-growing cells in the vicinity of faster growing tissue, suggests that uniform growth is not a default state but a result of active regulation. How can a patch of tissue compare its growth rate with that of its surroundings? A possible way is furnished by mechanical interactions. To demonstrate this mechanism, we formulate a mathematical model of nonuniform growth in a layer of tissue and examine its mechanical implications. We show that a clone growing faster or slower than the surrounding tissue is subject to mechanical stress, and we propose that dependence of the rate of cell division on local stress could provide an “integral-feedback” mechanism stabilizing uniform growth. The proposed mechanism of growth control is not specific to imaginal disc growth and could be of general relevance. Several experimental tests of the proposed mechanism are suggested.},

In Drosophila, tumorigenic cells mutant for the cell polarity gene scribble (scrib) are actively eliminated from epithelia when surrounded by wild-type cells. While scrib cell elimination depends critically on JNK signaling, JNKdependent cell death cannot sufﬁciently explain scrib cell extirpation. Thus, how JNK executed cell elimination remained elusive. Here, we show that repulsive Slit-Robo2-Ena signaling exerts an extrusive force downstream of JNK to eliminate scrib cells from epithelia by disrupting E-cadherin. While loss of Slit-Robo2-Ena in scrib cells potentiates scrib tumor formation within the epithelium, Robo2-Ena hyperactivation surprisingly triggers luminal scrib tumor growth following excess extrusion. This extrusive signaling is ampliﬁed by a positive feedback loop between Slit-Robo2-Ena and JNK. Our observations provide a potential causal mechanism for Slit-Robo dysregulation in numerous human cancers.},

              Cell competition is an emerging principle that eliminates suboptimal or potentially dangerous cells. For ‘unfit’ cells to be detected, their competitive status needs to be compared to the collective fitness of cells within a tissue. Here we report that the NMDA receptor controls cell competition of epithelial cells and Myc supercompetitors in the
              Drosophila
              wing disc. While clonal depletion of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2 results in their rapid elimination via the TNF/Eiger{\textgreater}JNK signalling pathway, local over-expression of NR2 causes NR2 cells to acquire supercompetitor-like behaviour that enables them to overtake the tissue through clonal expansion that causes, but also relies on, the killing of surrounding cells. Consistently, NR2 is utilised by Myc clones to provide them with supercompetitor status. Mechanistically, we find that the JNK{\textgreater}PDK signalling axis in ‘loser’ cells reprograms their metabolism, driving them to produce and transfer lactate to winners. Preventing lactate transfer from losers to winners abrogates NMDAR-mediated cell competition. Our findings demonstrate a functional repurposing of NMDAR in the surveillance of tissue fitness.},

              Drosophila
              cells perceived as unfit. We find that Toll-related receptors (TRRs) and the cytokine Spätzle (Spz) lead to NFκB-dependent apoptosis. Diverse “loser” cells require different TRRs and NFκB factors and activate distinct pro-death genes, implying that the particular response is stipulated by the competitive context. Our findings demonstrate a functional repurposing of components of TRRs and NFκB signaling modules in the surveillance of cell fitness during development.

              Even in what appears to be homogeneous tissue, cell variability exists. The presence of mutant cells can compromise the functional integrity of a tissue and ultimately the organism's health. Cell competition is an internal cell surveillance mechanism that monitors cell fitness to eliminate compromised cells and prevent them from contributing to the tissue. However, how cells recognize fitness differences has remained elusive. Meyer
              et al.
              report that this recognition uses signaling pathways from the innate immune response system. Cell-cell differences in fitness activate distinct NF-κB/Rel factors in the weaker population that lead to activation of distinct pro-apoptotic genes, leading to cell death in the losing cells.

In Drosophila, apart from its role in innate immunity, this pathway has also been reported to be important for the elimination of loser cells in a process referred to as cell competition, which can be locally triggered by secreted factors released from winner cells. In this work, we provide evidence that the inhibition of Toll signaling not only increases the fitness of loser cells, but also bestows a clonal growth advantage on wild-type cells. We further demonstrate that this growth advantage depends on basal infection levels since it is no longer present under axenic conditions but exacerbated upon intense pathogen exposure. Thus, the Toll pathway functions as a fine-tuned pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative regulator, underlining the existence of a trade-off between innate immunity and growth during development.},

	abstract = {Regulation of cell growth and proliferation has a fundamental role in animal and plant development and in the progression of cancer. In the context of development, it is important to understand the mechanisms that coordinate growth and patterning of tissues. Imaginal discs, which are larval precursors of fly limbs and organs, have provided much of what we currently know about these processes. Here, we consider the mechanism that is responsible for the observed uniformity of growth in wing imaginal discs, which persists in the presence of gradients in growth inducing morphogens in spite of the stochastic nature of cell division. The phenomenon of “cell competition,” which manifests in apoptosis of slower-growing cells in the vicinity of faster growing tissue, suggests that uniform growth is not a default state but a result of active regulation. How can a patch of tissue compare its growth rate with that of its surroundings? A possible way is furnished by mechanical interactions. To demonstrate this mechanism, we formulate a mathematical model of nonuniform growth in a layer of tissue and examine its mechanical implications. We show that a clone growing faster or slower than the surrounding tissue is subject to mechanical stress, and we propose that dependence of the rate of cell division on local stress could provide an “integral-feedback” mechanism stabilizing uniform growth. The proposed mechanism of growth control is not specific to imaginal disc growth and could be of general relevance. Several experimental tests of the proposed mechanism are suggested.},

The distribution of these polygon numbers has been shown to be conserved. Revealing the mechanisms that lead to this topology might yield insights into how the structural integrity of epithelial tissues is maintained. It has previously been proposed that cell division alone, or cell division in combination with cell rearrangements, is sufficient to explain the observed epithelial topology. Here, we extend this work by including an analysis of the clustering and the polygon distribution of mitotic cells. In addition, we study possible effects of cellular growth regulation by mechanical forces, as such regulation has been proposed to be involved in wing disc size regulation. We formulated several theoretical scenarios that differ with respect to whether cell rearrangements are allowed and whether cellular growth rates are dependent on mechanical stress. We then compared these scenarios with experimental data on the polygon distribution of the entire cell population, that of mitotic cells, as well as with data on mitotic clustering. Surprisingly, we observed considerably less clustering in our experiments than has been reported previously. Only scenarios that include mechanical-stress-dependent growth rates are in agreement with the experimental data. Interestingly, simulations of these scenarios showed a large decrease in rearrangements and elimination of cells. Thus, a possible growth regulation by mechanical force could have a function in releasing the mechanical stress that evolves when all cells have similar growth rates.},

              Cell competition is a quality control mechanism that eliminates unfit cells. How cells compete is poorly understood, but it is generally accepted that molecular exchange between cells signals elimination of unfit cells. Here we report an orthogonal mechanism of cell competition, whereby cells compete through mechanical insults. We show that MDCK cells silenced for the polarity gene

Compaction, via activation of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and the stress kinase p38, leads to further p53 elevation, causing cell death. Thus, in addition to molecules, cells use mechanical means to compete. Given the involvement of p53, compaction hypersensitivity may be widespread among damaged cells and offers an additional route to eliminate unfit cells.},

Prior to somitogenesis expression of both Nanog and Oct4 is regionalized. We show that pluripotency tracks the in vivo level of Oct4 and not Nanog by assessing the ability to reactivate or maintain Nanog expression in cell culture. Enforced Oct4 expression in somitogenesis-stage tissue provokes rapid reopening of Oct4 and Nanog chromatin, Nanog re-expression and resuscitates moribund pluripotency. Our data suggest that decreasing Oct4 expression is converted to a sudden drop in competence to maintain pluripotency gene regulatory network activity that is subsequently stabilized by epigenetic locks.},

Here we characterize in a spatially resolved manner the single-cell transcriptional profile of an entire gastrulating human embryo, staged to be between 16 and 19 days after fertilization. We use these data to analyse the cell types present and to make comparisons with other model systems. In addition to pluripotent epiblast, we identified primordial germ cells, red blood cells and various mesodermal and endodermal cell types. This dataset offers a unique glimpse into a central but inaccessible stage of our development. This characterization provides new context for interpreting experiments in other model systems and represents a valuable resource for guiding directed differentiation of human cells in vitro.},

Whereas the mechanisms of TE specification have been extensively studied, segregation of PrE and the pluripotent epiblast (EPI) has received comparatively little attention. A current model of PrE specification suggests PrE precursors exhibit an apparently random distribution within the inner cell mass of the early blastocyst and then segregate to their final position lining the cavity by the late blastocyst. We have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfrα) as an early-expressed protein that is also a marker of the later PrE lineage. By combining live imaging of embryos expressing a histone H2B-GFP fusion protein reporter under the control of Pdgfra regulatory elements with the analysis of lineage-specific markers, we investigated the events leading to PrE and EPI lineage segregation in the mouse, and correlated our findings using an embryo staging system based on total cell number. Before blastocyst formation, lineage-specific factors are expressed in an overlapping manner. Subsequently, a gradual progression towards a mutually exclusive expression of PrE- and EPI-specific markers occurs. Finally, cell sorting is achieved by a variety of cell behaviours and by selective apoptosis.},

Using single-cell transcriptional profiling of eliminated mouse epiblast cells, we identify hallmarks of cell competition and mitochondrial defects. We demonstrate that mitochondrial defects are common to a range of different loser cell types and that manipulating mitochondrial function triggers cell competition. Moreover, we show that in the mouse embryo, cell competition eliminates cells with sequence changes in mt-Rnr1 and mt-Rnr2, and that even non-pathological changes in mitochondrial DNA sequences can induce cell competition. Our results suggest that cell competition is a purifying selection that optimizes mitochondrial performance before gastrulation.},

Size regulation occurred simultaneously in all tissues, suggesting that a single regulatory mechanism may control size in the early embryo. Size regulation appeared to be brought about by alteration in cell cycle length. There was no obvious increase in cell death in the double embryos nor an increase in the non-dividing cell population. However, colcemid treatment revealed a significant difference in mitotic index between double and control embryos over the period of size regulation. Control embryos showed a proliferative burst around 6 days, 8 h p.c. which did not occur in the double embryos. It is not yet clear whether this control of proliferative activity in double embryos is exerted by the embryo itself or by the uterine environment.},

These conditions shield pluripotent cells from differentiation-inducing stimuli. We investigate the effect of these inhibitors on the development of pluripotent epiblast in intact pre-implantation embryos. We find that blockade of Erk signalling from the 8-cell stage does not impede blastocyst formation but suppresses development of the hypoblast. The size of the inner cell mass (ICM) compartment is not reduced, however. Throughout the ICM, the epiblast-specific marker Nanog is expressed, and in XX embryos epigenetic silencing of the paternal X chromosome is erased. Epiblast identity and pluripotency were confirmed by contribution to chimaeras with germline transmission. These observations indicate that segregation of hypoblast from the bipotent ICM is dependent on FGF/Erk signalling and that in the absence of this signal, the entire ICM can acquire pluripotency. Furthermore, the epiblast does not require paracrine support from the hypoblast. Thus, naïve epiblast and ES cells are in a similar ground state, with an autonomous capacity for survival and replication, and high vulnerability to Erk signalling. We probed directly the relationship between naïve epiblast and ES cells. Dissociated ICM cells from freshly harvested late blastocysts gave rise to up to 12 ES cell clones per embryo when plated in the presence of inhibitors. We propose that ES cells are not a tissue culture creation, but are essentially identical to preimplantation epiblast cells.},

            Intercellular communication is essential to coordinate the behaviour of individual cells during organismal development. The preimplantation mammalian embryo is a paradigm of tissue self-organization and regulative development; however, the cellular basis of these regulative abilities has not been established. Here we use a quantitative image analysis pipeline to undertake a high-resolution, single-cell level analysis of lineage specification in the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mouse blastocyst. We show that a consistent ratio of epiblast and primitive endoderm lineages is achieved through incremental allocation of cells from a common progenitor pool, and that the lineage composition of the ICM is conserved regardless of its size. Furthermore, timed modulation of the FGF-MAPK pathway shows that individual progenitors commit to either fate asynchronously during blastocyst development. These data indicate that such incremental lineage allocation provides the basis for a tissue size control mechanism that ensures the generation of lineages of appropriate size.},

	abstract = {Primitive endoderm (PE) and epiblast (EPI) are two lineages derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the E3.5 blastocyst. Recent studies showed that EPI and PE progenitors expressing the lineage-specific transcriptional factors Nanog and Gata6, respectively, arise progressively as the ICM develops. Subsequent sorting of the two progenitors during blastocyst maturation results in the ormation of morphologically distinct EPI and PE layers at E4.5. It is, however, unknown how the initial differences between the two populations become established in the E3.5 blastocyst. Because the ICM cells are derived from two distinct rounds of polarized cell divisions during cleavage, a possible role for cell lineage history in promoting EPI versus PE fate has been proposed. We followed cell lineage from the eight-cell stage by live cell tracing and could find no clear linkage between developmental history of individual ICM cells and later cell fate. However, modulating FGF signaling levels by inhibition of the receptor/MAP kinase pathway or by addition of exogenous FGF shifted the fate of ICM cells to become either EPI or PE, respectively. Nanog- or Gata6-expressing progenitors could still be shifted towards the alternative fate by modulating FGF signaling during blastocyst maturation, suggesting that the ICM progenitors are not fully committed to their final fate at the time that initial segregation of gene expression occurs. In conclusion, we propose a model in which stochastic and progressive specification of EPI and PE lineages occurs during maturation of the blastocyst in an FGF/MAP kinase signal-dependent manner.},

	abstract = {Cell differentiation during pre-implantation mammalian development involves the formation of two extra-embryonic lineages: trophoblast and primitive endoderm (PrE). A subset of cells within the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst does not respond to differentiation signals and forms the pluripotent epiblast, which gives rise to all of the tissues in the adult body. How this group of cells is set aside remains unknown. Recent studies documented distinct sequential phases of marker expression during the segregation of epiblast and PrE within the ICM. However, the connection between marker expression and lineage commitment remains unclear. Using a fluorescent reporter for PrE, we investigated the plasticity of epiblast and PrE precursors. Our observations reveal that loss of plasticity does not coincide directly with lineage restriction of epiblast and PrE markers, but rather with exclusion of the pluripotency marker Oct4 from the PrE. We note that individual ICM cells can contribute to all three lineages of the blastocyst until peri-implantation. However, epiblast precursors exhibit less plasticity than precursors of PrE, probably owing to differences in responsiveness to extracellular signalling. We therefore propose that the early embryo environment restricts the fate choice of epiblast but not PrE precursors, thus ensuring the formation and preservation of the pluripotent foetal lineage.},

The results indicate that whereas ICM cells divide at a rate which is compatible with the rate of increase of ICM cell number, polar trophectoderm cells divide faster and mural trophectoderm cells slower than can account for their own rates of cell number increase. It is suggested that the ICM induces a high rate of proliferation in the polar trophectoderm and that there is a resulting cell shift from polar to mural regions during blastocyst development. Mural trophectoderm cells close to the ICM divide faster than those farther away, indicating that cells may retain a 'memory' of ICM contact for some time after leaving the ICM. There is considerable cell death in the blastocyst, but this is restricted to a short period of time coincident with the appearance of primitive endoderm.},

Whereas the mechanisms of TE specification have been extensively studied, segregation of PrE and the pluripotent epiblast (EPI) has received comparatively little attention. A current model of PrE specification suggests PrE precursors exhibit an apparently random distribution within the inner cell mass of the early blastocyst and then segregate to their final position lining the cavity by the late blastocyst. We have identified plateletderived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfrα) as an early-expressed protein that is also a marker of the later PrE lineage. By combining live imaging of embryos expressing a histone H2B-GFP fusion protein reporter under the control of Pdgfra regulatory elements with the analysis of lineage-specific markers, we investigated the events leading to PrE and EPI lineage segregation in the mouse, and correlated our findings using an embryo staging system based on total cell number. Before blastocyst formation, lineage-specific factors are expressed in an overlapping manner. Subsequently, a gradual progression towards a mutually exclusive expression of PrE- and EPI-specific markers occurs. Finally, cell sorting is achieved by a variety of cell behaviours and by selective apoptosis.},

            Cell competition is a homeostatic mechanism that regulates the size attained by growing tissues. We performed an unbiased genetic screen for mutations that permit the survival of cells being competed due to haplo-insufficiency for RpL36. Mutations that protect RpL36 heterozygous clones include the tumor suppressors expanded, hippo, salvador, mats, and warts, which are members of the Warts pathway, the tumor suppressor fat, and a novel tumor-suppressor mutation. Other hyperplastic or neoplastic mutations did not rescue RpL36 heterozygous clones. Most mutations that rescue cell competition elevated Dpp-signaling activity, and the Dsmurf mutation that elevates Dpp signaling was also hyperplastic and rescued. Two nonlethal, nonhyperplastic mutations prevent the apoptosis of Minute heterozygous cells and suggest an apoptosis pathway for cell competition . In addition to rescuing RpL36 heterozygous cells, mutations in Warts pathway genes were supercompetitors that could eliminate wild-type cells nearby. The findings show that differences in Warts pathway activity can lead to competition and implicate the Warts pathway, certain other tumor suppressors, and novel cell death components in cell competition, in addition to the Dpp pathway implicated by previous studies. We suggest that cell competition might occur during tumor development in mammals.},

Here, we report single cell RNA-sequencing of mESCs cultured in three different conditions: serum, 2i, and the alternative ground state a2i. We find that the cellular transcriptomes of cells grown in these conditions are distinct, with 2i being the most similar to blastocyst cells and including a subpopulation resembling the two-cell embryo state. Overall levels of intercellular gene expression heterogeneity are comparable across the three conditions. However, this masks variable expression of pluripotency genes in serum cells and homogeneous expression in 2i and a2i cells. Additionally, genes related to the cell cycle are more variably expressed in the 2i and a2i conditions. Mining of our dataset for correlations in gene expression allowed us to identify additional components of the pluripotency network, including Ptma and Zfp640, illustrating its value as a resource for future discovery.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Previous studies suggest that only a minority of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) inoculum contributes to the adult chimaera. How incoming cells are chosen for integration or elimination remains unclear. By comparing a heterogeneous mix of undifferentiated and differentiating ESCs (Serum/LIF) with more homogeneous undifferentiated culture (2i/LIF) we examine the role of cellular heterogeneity in this process. Time-lapse ex vivo imaging revealed a drastic elimination of Serum/LIF ESCs during early development in comparison with 2i/LIF ESCs. Using a fluorescent reporter for naïve pluripotency (Rex1GFP), we established that the acutely eliminated Serum/LIF ESCs had begun to differentiate. The rejected cells were apparently killed by apoptosis. We conclude that a selection process exists by which unwanted differentiating cells are eliminated from the embryo. However, occasional Rex1-negative cells were able to integrate. Up-regulation of Rex1 occurred in a proportion of these, reflecting the potential of the embryonic environment to expedite diversion from differentiation priming to enhance the developing embryonic epiblast.},

These cells express Oct3/4 and Rex1 genes, which have been used as markers to indicate the undifferentiated state of ES cells. Whereas Oct3/4 is expressed in totipotent and pluripotent cells in the mouse life cycle, Rex1 expression is restricted to the ICM, and is downregulated in pluripotent cell populations in the later stages, i.e. the epiblast and primitive ectoderm (PrE). To address whether ES cells comprise a homogeneous population equivalent to a certain developmental stage of pluripotent cells or a heterogeneous population composed of cells corresponding to various stages of differentiation, we established knock-in ES cell lines in which genes for fluorescent proteins were inserted into the Rex1 and Oct3/4gene loci to visualize the expression of these genes. We found that undifferentiated ES cells included at least two different populations, Rex1+/Oct3/4+ cells and Rex1-/Oct3/4+ cells. The Rex1-/Oct3/4+ and Rex1+/Oct3/4+ populations could convert into each other in the presence of LIF. In accordance with our assumption that Rex1+/Oct3/4+ cells and Rex1-/Oct3/4+ cells have characteristics similar to those of ICM and early-PrE cells, Rex1+/Oct3/4+ cells predominantly differentiated into primitive ectoderm and contributed to chimera formation,whereas Rex1-/Oct3/4+ cells differentiated into cells of the somatic lineage more efficiently than non-fractionated ES cells in vitro and showed poor ability to contribute to chimera formation. These results confirmed that undifferentiated ES cell culture contains subpopulations corresponding to ICM, epiblast and PrE.},

Here we show that transient promotion of cell survival through expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 enables EpiSCs and Sox17+ endoderm progenitors to integrate into blastocysts and contribute to chimeric embryos. Upon injection into blastocyst, BCL2-expressing EpiSCs contributed to all bodily tissues in chimeric animals while Sox17+ endoderm progenitors speciﬁcally contributed in a region-speciﬁc fashion to endodermal tissues. In addition, BCL2 expression enabled rat EpiSCs to contribute to mouse embryonic chimeras, thereby forming interspecies chimeras that could survive to adulthood. Our system therefore provides a method to overcome cellular compatibility issues that typically restrict chimera formation. Application of this type of approach could broaden the use of embryonic chimeras, including region-speciﬁc chimeras, for basic developmental biology research and regenerative medicine.},

            About 2 per cent of specimens from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) analysed either on direct preparation of cytotrophoblast cells or afterculture of mesenchymal stroma reveal confined placental mosaicism (CPM), most commonly involving chromosomal trisomy. A significantly higher rate of prenatal loss (22 per cent) as well as the presence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been reported among pregnancies with CPM. To evaluate more precisely the effect of these aneuploid cell lines confined to the placenta on intrauterine fetal growth and fetal survival, we have studied 34 term placentae from pregnancies with CPM diagnosed on CVS and confirmed identical mosaicism in 17 of these placentae. There was a direct correlation between a high number of aneuploid cells present at CVS and a high likelihood of their detection in term placenta. Also, the proportion of aneuploid cells in the mosaic term placentae correlated with that observed in CVS specimens. Among 17 gestations with confirmed CPM at delivery, there were six cases of IUGR identified, five in liveborns and one associated with intrauterine death.},

            The high incidence of aneuploidy in the embryo is considered the principal cause for low human fecundity. However, the prevalence of aneuploidy dramatically declines as pregnancy progresses, with the steepest drop occurring as the embryo completes implantation. Despite the fact that the plasticity of the embryo in dealing with aneuploidy is fundamental to normal development, the mechanisms responsible for eliminating aneuploid cells are unclear. Here, using a mouse model of chromosome mosaicism, we show that aneuploid cells are preferentially eliminated from the embryonic lineage in a p53-dependent process involving both autophagy and apoptosis before, during and after implantation. Moreover, we show that diploid cells in mosaic embryos undertake compensatory proliferation during the implantation stages to confer embryonic viability. Together, our results indicate a close link between aneuploidy, autophagy, and apoptosis to refine the embryonic cell population and ensure only chromosomally fit cells proceed through development of the fetus.},

	abstract = {Less than half of human zygotes survive to birth, primarily due to aneuploidies of meiotic or mitotic origin. Mitotic errors generate chromosomal mosaicism, defined by multiple cell lineages with distinct chromosome complements. The incidence and impacts of mosaicism in human embryos remain controversial, with most previous studies based on bulk DNA assays or comparisons of multiple biopsies of few embryonic cells. Single-cell genomic data provide an opportunity to quantify mosaicism on an embryo-wide scale. To this end, we extended an approach to infer aneuploidies based on dosage-associated changes in gene expression by integrating signatures of allelic imbalance. We applied this method to published single-cell RNA sequencing data from 74 human embryos, spanning the morula to blastocyst stages. Our analysis revealed widespread mosaic aneuploidies, with 59 of 74 (80\%) embryos harboring at least one putative aneuploid cell (1\% FDR). By clustering copy number calls, we reconstructed histories of chromosome segregation, inferring that 55 (74\%) embryos possessed mitotic aneuploidies and 23 (31\%) embryos possessed meiotic aneuploidies. We found no significant enrichment of aneuploid cells in the trophectoderm compared to the inner cell mass, although we do detect such enrichment in data from later postimplantation stages. Finally, we observed that aneuploid cells up-regulate immune response genes and down-regulate genes involved in proliferation, metabolism, and protein processing, consistent with stress responses documented in other stages and systems. Together, our work provides a high-resolution view of aneuploidy in preimplantation embryos, and supports the conclusion that low-level mosaicism is a common feature of early human development.},

Variant hPSCs that harbor recurrent culture-acquired aneuploidies display growth advantages over wild-type diploid cells, but the mechanisms that yield a drift from predominantly wild-type to variant cell populations remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the dominance of variant clones in mosaic cultures is enhanced through competitive interactions that result in the elimination of wild-type cells. This elimination occurs through corralling and mechanical compression by faster-growing variants, causing a redistribution of F-actin and sequestration of yes-associated protein (YAP) in the cytoplasm that induces apoptosis in wild-type cells. YAP overexpression or promotion of YAP nuclear localization in wild-type cells alleviates their ‘‘loser’’ phenotype. Our results demonstrate that hPSC fate is coupled to mechanical cues imposed by neighboring cells and reveal that hijacking this mechanism allows variants to achieve clonal dominance in cultures.},

Coincidental with the appearance of the primitive streak the embryo enters a period of rapid growth, lasting about 24 h, during which the mean cell generation time must be about 5 h in order to account for the increase in cell numbers. A more detailed study, in which variations in mitotic activity in different regions of the embryo have been analysed, has identified a small region, the so-called 'proliferative zone', constituting about 10 \% of the whole epiblast, in which cell generation time may average as little as 2-3 h over a 24 h period. The cell generation time for other epiblast regions is estimated at about 6-5 h. It is calculated that the proliferative zone, in the 24 h period commencing with primitive streak formation, could generate about half the cells in the 7{\textasciicircum}-day embryo. The topographical consequences of such a rapidly expanding region in the embryo are discussed in the light of other, circumstantial evidence, and it is postulated that the cells generated in the PZ may constitute the ectoderm of later stage embryos.},

We ﬁnd that in the pluripotent epiblast they inhibit apoptosis by blocking the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl2l11 (Bim) but play little role in the initiation of gastrulation. In contrast, in the trophectoderm, miRNAs maintain the trophoblast stem cell compartment by directly inhibiting expression of Cdkn1a (p21) and Cdkn1c (p57), and in the primitive endoderm, they prevent differentiation by maintaining ERK1/2 phosphorylation through blocking the expression of Mapk inhibitors. Therefore, we show that there are fundamental differences in how stem cells maintain their developmental potential in embryonic and extraembryonic tissues through miRNAs.},
